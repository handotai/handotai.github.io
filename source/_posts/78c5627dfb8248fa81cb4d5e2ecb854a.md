# Today stuff

- Day is quite bleak

- Senior design project is still in the air, idk

  - I am trying to buy some chips with amazon prime to decode it faster since i think my baud rates are too slow
  - Ughhhhhhhhh
  - Just want this quarter to end, everything about it sucks

- I'm getting an interview for a job next week, hope that goes well

  - Not exactly my field but I guess it's better than nothing
  - Hopefully I can refer a friend over to this company as well since he seems to be a better major fit
  - I got a big ass wacom cintiq for free and a wacom pen for it (\$35)

    - I got what was the Intuos Pro Option Pen for the Cintiq 22HD (DTK-2200)
    - It came with a mount but no screws
    - Thankfully, I looked up online but the screw length was kind of obscure, some people said 20-22 mm M4 but I eventually settled on an M4, 12 mm screw. The 10mm was for a completely different model that other people had mentioned
    - The cintiq was slightly dusty but it still works like if it was used
      - For a 1080P monitor this is kind of amazing
    - Total, I think it came out to \$35 + 2 dollars for screws
    - Insane how this used to cost \$2000 in 2012
    - I'm probably gonna gift this to a friend but I'll have to see, since I have an ipad with an apple pencil already

- Watched some videos on guitar, I'm gonna learn to reverse engineer songs with the major/minor scales as my approach

  - My issue back then was that I kept failing at trying to understand how to learn guitar based off chords and timing alone with some guitar/tab tutorials, but I want to do a different approach with this, hopefully it turns out well

anki

- 「鋼の錬金術師 」：第 1 話読書中
- 「ジョジョの奇妙な冒険：ステイるーぼルーラン」：第 **4** 話完成
- 「よつば＆！」：第 4 話完成
- チ。「―地球の運動について―」完成

 

# GUITAR

- Learned about scales (2/23)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
