# Today stuff

- IT (was) CHRISTMASSSSSSS
- Went to las vegas for a couple days
  - Long drive but it was cool, didnt really like gambling but it was nice to go back after a long while
  - Ate a lot of good foods and lots of food comas
- Sad things have come
  - I broke the 512 GB sd card on my pi 3, this is so sad
    - I'm deciding to just setup ubuntu on my pixel instead and run the calibre-server script off there, I figured it would be one less component to use
    - In the meanwhile I think next time i'll just get a 128GB or something smaller instead
    - If I decide to stop doing the offline kindle library on my pi, i'll just use the pi for octoprint instead
- Also I kinda gave up on the oscilloscope repair, I just tried to move the scope buttons and clean it up a bit but I can't fix the knob, still stuck on soldering the part together
- Even more sadder news, I broke a capacitor off my artix trying to leverage the FPGA off the board for a senior design project :(
  - <img src="/resources/f435594b101a4bdbb033c34003ce6424.png" alt="69da88099a0d24bcf6d3f3d5393b9e73.png" width="626" height="441" class="jop-noMdConv">
  - (circled in red), I found the component name, it's 0805 and a 1nF cap, thank goodness to the datasheet and the cap info on digilent forums, they have a spreadsheet of the caps used
  - It broke off when I was trying to leverag using a wire cutter, i put too much pressure on the bottom prying it up and it smashed the capacitor into dust

  - <https://www.avnet.com/fsp/opasdata/d120001/medias/docus/10/Schematics-Artix-35T-Arty.pdf>
- I upgraded all my devices that I SSH into with public key encryption, to add an extra layer of protection
  - God windows is a pain with this
- I've been meaning to switch over my win10 to Bazzite as my new OS, I think it's time considering the way I don't like how windows 11 is so privacy-breaching and bazzite is much gaming-focused and lets me use my development skills
- Also I put firefox on keepassXC and put my password database on nextcloud, so it should totally be able to update on the fly which is epic

# JP

anki

- 「鋼の錬金術師 」：第 1 話読書中
- 「ジョジョの奇妙な冒険：ステイるーぼルーラン」：第 **4** 話完成
- 「よつば＆！」：第 4 話完成

 

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
