# Today stuff

- Went to go to a woodshop with a friend
  - Learned that they calculated wood with a thing called "board-foot", a measurement of the  LxWxH of a board divided by 144, the 12x12x1 inches cubed as a form of selling its unit price
  - My friend wanted to do some woodworkign to make a guitar but wood is quite expensive
  - At this point in time mahogany wood was like $11 per bf (used for guitar bodies)
  - Had to settle for a less expensive wood like poplar which was like $3.8 per bf instead
  - We were also gonna get wood for the neck but we ran out of time
- Ate at a pretty crappy chinese food restaurant, by far the worst taste-wise
- Went to the uni's liquidation store and got myself a really cool vintage PC

  - Got a mac iisi from the 80-90's
  - Gonna see if it boots and then later i'm gonna do a sleeper build with it with my RTX 3070 which i think would be funny
  - My only problem is that it might be too small and too stuffy in there cuz there's not a lot of exhaust fans in it
- Also got a raspberry pi 4 for 15 bucks
  - I might use it for a home assistant down the line cuz I bought security cams for my house but I haven't set it all up yet
- My sis came over to my uni and we ate dinner
  - I got my RTX 3070 finally picked up from back home
  - Gonna test it out when i get back home this weekend

 

# JP

anki

Immersion

# GUITAR

- No progress since yesterday
  - Still on haruka kanata verse 1, stuck on doing b over d sharp
  - I did a little bit of it but it still doesn't sound good

# ENGINEERING

- Thought about making a small BOM,  I saw that apparently there are such things as a 3.7V 10000 mAh = 37Wh LiPo battery which I think i can use for a potentially viable nucdeck idea.

 

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case

Nucdeck idea

- Need to test eGPU out
- I think I need to either buy a low power mobo or stick with a intel nuc canyon which has tb3 ports and either connect it to the eGPU or check the tech specs if the bandwidth of the mobo can support PCIEx16 speeds to make this build viable

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
