# Today stuff

- ONE MORE QUARTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  - Since last log, I passed all my finals thank goodness, but my senior design project is hella lacking
  - I needa pick up the pace, gonna go in to lab during the time I have
  - It's kind of crazy this past month that I only have three months left of my uni left and then i'm out into the world
  - I need to cut my club participation way down because I'm graduating but I am gonna continue transferring my power over to other members
- Ive been working on a small private modpack with my friends using create + valkyrien skies + pomkots mechs, it's pretty cool and I hope it works
  - Scaling on pomkots is hella OP but im trying to nerf it a lil to make it more grounded
- Going back on my solar panel project, I realized I'm missing a backflow regulation when the solar panel doesn't recieve power
  - I need to give it a voltage regulator to share between the battery and some load so that it doesnt all go to the battery and wear it out
  - Referring to these <https://randomnerdtutorials.com/power-esp32-esp8266-solar-panels-battery-level-monitoring/>
  - This too <https://www.instructables.com/Solar-charging-ereader/>
  - Prolly will go to a electronics store to buy a regulator if the regulator I have doesnt' work
- Also, I tried my hand at opening up and repairing an oscilloscope I bought from goodwill
  - I knew to take precautions with high voltage so I mainly one-handed while working on the inside of the board and didn't mess with the tube

  - It turns out that the rotary switch I was trying to replace is called "J-NOBLE ADR255S V8610", and doing a quick search on ebay for this part revealed it was 40 bucks, I wasnt' gonna have it.
    - I think I'm just gonna see if I can solder back the metal piece from the broken-off knob switch if that would work
- Also, I am gonna replace all my passwords with KeepassXC and their firefox extension, it's so ridiculous how much of a pain setting up passwords are. I hooked it to my nextcloud as well, so I'll always have it on me.
  - Speaking of nextcloud, I'm gonna put my HDD storage onto my homeassistant and then host a webDAV to see my files off there, I realized that the local storage off the OS isn't good since it doesn't refresh and recognize itself
  - It would be better to get access to the HDD folder through the webDAV so if it does go down it can try reconnecting, no big deal, compared to restarting my nextcloud computer just to have it recognize again

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
