# Today stuff

- Kindle arrived!
  - Took a while but i finally jailbreaked it
  - I had a kindle 4, what did it was this post: <https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/1ipko3u/comment/mcw6m8t/>
  - I still need to figure out how to make an offline library
  - I'm planning to use a raspberry pi 3A+ since its a low power raspberry pi (can take like 10W of energy and still run stuff)
  - I plan to use Calibre-web since its fairly well integrated, but I want it to point to my nextcloud instance so that it can retrieve my mangas there
  - Reason being is that since my kindle is only like 2 gigs it cant really store much mangas, so having the ability to have this raspberry pi as an offline library would be huge since I wouldnt need much power to run it and i can take it with me on the go
- I bought myself a new drawer
  - Put a buncha stuff away so I finally have space in my room, looks a lot tidier but still could be improved
  - I saw a post about changing the mac IIsi that I bought from uni to replace the old one that burnt out, so I might also take a look at that
    - <https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageApple/comments/177q3u2/can_i_use_a_picopsu_atx_to_replace_the_psu_of_a/>
- I still needa call the apartment complexes to get a short term lease

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
