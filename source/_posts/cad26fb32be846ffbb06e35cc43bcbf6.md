# Today stuff

- More schooooolll
- Starting to try and do research over the quarter, I asked the PHD I was working with to get back to base with him so I'm hoping tomorrow will go well, feel slightly anxious but I think I can do it.
- ALSO: Back from the [Today stuff 12](/p/8c08652cc9174909a0e4ad9bfd009329) entry, I actually realized you need to also turn off private WiFi Address entirely, not "Fixed" but "Off" because wireguard will try to act on your IP address but then your OS will spoof a different address to that network, effectively causing no traffic to you from your VPN. Kinda sucks that it has that vulnerability but it works.
  - Also I bought large foam sponges for my air conditioning unit to monitor leaks and provide as a height + soak up excess water.
- I also bought new headphones, the Sennheiser HD599's. I think the padding is pretty nice; I saw reviews that the headband is fake leather and flakes off, so I'm buying a band protector for it.
  - I also tried listening to songs with this and I felt it was way different from my SHP9500s, it added clearer sound stages and I think boosted the clarity of the instruments in the songs I listened to about 25-40% more clearer. If anything I do really like the drivers these headphones offer.
  - I got it for $100, and I think although reviews say the fitting is extremely light, I don't actually see it; the fit is quite noticeably firm so I'm quite skeptical of putting on it long-term. I'll have to see how it feels in prolonged sessions.
    - In fact I bought a spare pads and I felt that they were actually softer than the one provided in the box.
    - <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYM81DTX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1>
    - The earpads in the box is velour while these are memory foam. Surprisingly I thought the velour would be more softer but they are firmer than the memory foam. I might actually use the replacement pads first because of how firm the velour pads are being right now on my ears.
    - Replacing the pads were surprisingly easy. You just plick the pad out from the inside.
  - Despite being open back these headphones are quite closed in regards to sound leak. Somewhat of a plus.
  - Also, a bit of a bummer but you need a pretty long cable to stick up into the cord port unlike the SHP9500s which you just directly insert into the socket. This is annoying, I don't think my headphone adapters will work with this if it's too short. I'm a bit worried about that affecting longevity.
- Also, I thrifted a really old vintage keyboard. It's a ZEOS NTC-KB6251EA. It has Alps White SKCM switches which I found really rare. I only paid a $1.08 for it!!!
  - Typing on it is quite jarring though, it might need lubing. The switches take a insane amount of actuation force just to press down and register after doing some runs on typemonkey.
  - I also found a cable adapter for DIN5 to Apple ADB, which means I can use this keyboard on a old Macintosh, which is perfect for what I was trying to go for.

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
