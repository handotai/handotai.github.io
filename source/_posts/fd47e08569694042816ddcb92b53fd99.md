# Today stuff

- Refunded back a buncha amazon stuff
- Okay, to even further clarify from yesterday, the MOBO i have actually IS LGA1151, despite the newegg website telling me otherwise

- The alignment key most definitely fits so this mobo is very similar to mine in that regard

# GUITAR

- No progress since yesterday
  - Still on haruka kanata verse 1, stuck on doing b over d sharp
  - I did a little bit of it but it still doesn't sound good

# ENGINEERING

- Thought about making a small BOM,  I saw that apparently there are such things as a 3.7V 10000 mAh = 37Wh LiPo battery which I think i can use for a potentially viable nucdeck idea.

 

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case

Nucdeck idea

- Need to test eGPU out
- I think I need to either buy a low power mobo or stick with a intel nuc canyon which has tb3 ports and either connect it to the eGPU or check the tech specs if the bandwidth of the mobo can support PCIEx16 speeds to make this build viable

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb

Cool stuff

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
