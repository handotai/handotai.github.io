  - Soba noodles were kinda eh and i think i let the tempura too long, kinda tasted soggy
  - Ate natto and dumplings wit it
- Also went to get 6 dollar panda express and did some grocery shopping
  - I have way too much beef so i gotta start eating it
  - Gonna make sukiyaki later and some stir fry noodles
- After I did more homework
- I placed an order on the PC case so hopefully itll arrive soon, alongside a CPU cooler and fans
  - Since i cant really do an all-white PC i figured to buy black-white PC components cuz my GPU is black but my mobo is like black-whiteish
- Also i gotta go to microcenter tmrw since i have a backpack i wanna try on there
- Also ive been watching vids of mini-LED monitors vs. OLED, I tried out a MINILED at microcenter yesterday and it looked very good wiith black colors so i think i might buy a miniLED monitor
  - Also saw a OLED monitor there with burn in so i think imma veer away from OLEDs for a while
  - I need to also buy an NVME drive but gonna wait for a sale till then

 

# JP

anki

Immersion

# GUITAR

- No progress since yesterday
  - Still on haruka kanata verse 1, stuck on doing b over d sharp
  - I did a little bit of it but it still doesn't sound good

# ENGINEERING

- Thought about making a small BOM,  I saw that apparently there are such things as a 3.7V 10000 mAh = 37Wh LiPo battery which I think i can use for a potentially viable nucdeck idea.

 

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case

Nucdeck idea

- Need to test eGPU out
- I think I need to either buy a low power mobo or stick with a intel nuc canyon which has tb3 ports and either connect it to the eGPU or check the tech specs if the bandwidth of the mobo can support PCIEx16 speeds to make this build viable
