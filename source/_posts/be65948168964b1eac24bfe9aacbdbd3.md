# Today stuff

- Went back uni at 11 am
- Still thinking about buying the display adapter and keyboard+mouse for the apple mac iisi
- Spent up at midnight trying to finish a club org project
  - Kinda felt burnt out cuz I had too many people on my subgroup
  - Idk I don't really want to force people out but I think I need to learn to be mean to ppl

 

# JP

anki

- しませんでした

Immersion

- 最近無いです

 

# GUITAR

- No progress since yesterday
  - Still on haruka kanata verse 1, stuck on doing b over d sharp
  - I did a little bit of it but it still doesn't sound good

# ENGINEERING

- Thought about making a small BOM,  I saw that apparently there are such things as a 3.7V 10000 mAh = 37Wh LiPo battery which I think i can use for a potentially viable nucdeck idea.

 

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case

Nucdeck idea

- Need to test eGPU out
- I think I need to either buy a low power mobo or stick with a intel nuc canyon which has tb3 ports and either connect it to the eGPU or check the tech specs if the bandwidth of the mobo can support PCIEx16 speeds to make this build viable

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
