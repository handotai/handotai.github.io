# Today stuff

- School haseth startedeth
- My new apartment is hella convenient to a buncha places around it but the only problem is that we eventually started finding roaches which sucked
- I also replaced my google pixel 3a battery, turns out you need a decent amount of heat but not too much and the glass to pull it needs a decent amount of force (it doesnt break as easily as I thought)
  - The burn mark is kinda noticeable but if I put it under white or greenish light for the task bar it blends in with the rest of the screen
  - I'm planning to just keep it as-is and maybe add weaker glue or some sort of velcro later cuz I don't wanna have to re-heat the screen again and make it complicated

  - [IMG\_8780.HEIC](/resources/f1dc37238d664d419a9ef4c74f6ae53f.HEIC)
- I basically did a ton of grocery shopping this week and moving in a new mini fridge + furniture

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
