# Today stuff

- Finally moved into my new apartment
  - Drove an hour to sign move in sheets and set up wifi
  - So happy Im near a bunch of awesome places for my last months in uni

- But overall however I still feel kind of shitty, don:t know what to do with getting an internship and just losing hope in my career
  - Idk if its coping but Im just making whatever shit for a silly game because I have nothing btter to do
    - I also liked just hanging out with friends and that gave me a reason to do so
    - I:m hoping from doing this I can come to terms with myself and maybe I can find a way out of this rut

- Since uni starts next month I gotta start knowing my priorities, considering I only have 6 months left

# JP

anki

- 「よつば＆！」：第 2 話完成
- 「ジョジョの奇妙な冒険：ステイるーぼルーラン」：第 2 話完成

 

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
