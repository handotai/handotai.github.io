# Today stuff

- Well i forgot to keep track of keeping a weekly basis but I feel I should take the time to do this before I forget
- I think early this month I was mostly just chilling at home, then the first week of school was relatively normal, slightly frustrating with senior design project but I didn't have much to write about. I'm very glad I'm taking such a relaxed class list this time around.
- This week i been really sick, im glad i had a 3 day weekend but 80% of the time was dedicated just to resting
  - I think i ate a sandwich from one of my family members who was also sick a couple days ago and also got the same fever
  - Took a lot of advil and dayquil/nyquil but moving towards tylenol as an alternative, it kinda worked, on Saturday I think was when my fever got its worst and sunday it was halved
  - But still on tuesday I felt the fever headaches and didnt go to school so I stayed home to rest even more
  - I really want to start on my research project since I never got around to it, I need to get in touch with my TA this week to talk about an action plan.
- I didnt really do too much I think, well I did actually watch an anime when I was sick, it's called 「チ。―地球の運動について―」 
  - It's probably the first anime in a year, I barely watch anime but I felt that after trying to read japanese for so long and having trouble with the words I had to find a different method
  - I wanted to challenge myself this time so I did it almost completely japanese sub only
  - I finished it because the story was really interesting and creative, I did take a looot of mining though
    - A good majority of it is grammar and reused vocabs in their different grammatical forms, I think in terms of new words i'd say sub 200-400 words
    - I am hoping that I can anki the grammar since I've been severely lacking in my grammar and I felt this was a good idea
    - I do know that from [themoeway's updated strategy](https://learnjapanese.moe/shouimethod/) that japanese subs are a crutch, but I feel that this is the next best thing since I see no progress in my manga readings
      - I think the way my brain learns japanese has to be a phase of extreme repetition, ironing-out and only then after will I be able to see my results come to fruition
      - I do want to take themoeway's new advice on considering monolingual dictionaries (or none at all) on partial occasion; I am severely lacking in trying to decipher grammar and vocab from raw language and I think by mining with JP subs on it will help me build a pattern recognition skill
  - It was fun reading the subs and realizing a lot of words popping up recurrently, I think I'm on the right track. ASBplayer was especially helpful here. 
- Oh i guess for future plans, I had started a workout routine of 30-60 mins for three days a week (chest, back, leg days), I actually see a good improvement on my body so far, I gotta do backs when I get better.

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
