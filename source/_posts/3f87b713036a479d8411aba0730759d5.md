# Today stuff

- Decided to drop my summer classes due to financial aid issues
  - Gonna plan on taking the class either in fall quarter or at community college
- Tried fixing my 3D printer with Octoprint and auto bed leveling but it seems it doesn't like it
  - Autobed leveling is too high, probably need to fix the Zoffset
  - Gonna try this guide <https://github.com/fishsticksnom/kp3s_3d_touch_guide>
  - Octoprint apparently has a high resend rate so I'm gonna buy a USB printer cable with ferrite chokes to see if it can reduce noise since that's what a lot of users say worked for them
- Also I bought a E-ink tablet off goodwill, kinda had a rash decision but they looked super cool for 25 bux
  - Gonna jailbreak and sideload it with my Ebooks
- Also man my schedule is really messed up, I gotta sleep at 12 or 1 AM. I've been up latest at 5 AM recently and it's not healthy, I'm missing a lot of my day to be productive.

# JP

anki

- 第１話完成

 

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
