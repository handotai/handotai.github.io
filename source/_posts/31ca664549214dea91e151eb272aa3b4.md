# Today stuff

- stayed at home
- Went to best buy to check out new monitors
- Thinking of getting an OLED or a MINILED monitor
- Tried going to best buy and some other places to see if i could fit all my new pc components
- I think i gotta wait till i come back to uni to go to a microcenter to upgrade my pc
- Set up some security home cameras back home
  - Realized that they used wifi but i fixed it so that they dont send stuff across the internet, so it won't be an issue with spyware

 

 

# JP

anki

Immersion

# GUITAR

- No progress since yesterday
  - Still on haruka kanata verse 1, stuck on doing b over d sharp
  - I did a little bit of it but it still doesn't sound good

# ENGINEERING

- Thought about making a small BOM,  I saw that apparently there are such things as a 3.7V 10000 mAh = 37Wh LiPo battery which I think i can use for a potentially viable nucdeck idea.

 

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case

Nucdeck idea

- Need to test eGPU out
- I think I need to either buy a low power mobo or stick with a intel nuc canyon which has tb3 ports and either connect it to the eGPU or check the tech specs if the bandwidth of the mobo can support PCIEx16 speeds to make this build viable
