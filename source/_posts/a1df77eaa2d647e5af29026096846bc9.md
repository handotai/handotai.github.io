# Today stuff

# GUITAR

- No progress since yesterday
  - Still on haruka kanata verse 1, stuck on doing b over d sharp
  - I did a little bit of it but it still doesn't sound good

# ENGINEERING

- Thought about making a small BOM,  I saw that apparently there are such things as a 3.7V 10000 mAh = 37Wh LiPo battery which I think i can use for a potentially viable nucdeck idea.

 

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case

Nucdeck idea

- Need to test eGPU out
- I think I need to either buy a low power mobo or stick with a intel nuc canyon which has tb3 ports and either connect it to the eGPU or check the tech specs if the bandwidth of the mobo can support PCIEx16 speeds to make this build viable

# FUTURE PLANS
