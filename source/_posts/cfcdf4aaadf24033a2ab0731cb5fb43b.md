# Today stuff

- Went to daiso today to find a USB hub, couldnt find it so I just got food and went back home

  - Bought it off amazon now, needed it because I'm doing a pseudo-NAS storage on my intel NUC
  - My plan right now:
  - ![4e7581370f42649fcbc8c0c3a51617ee.png](/resources/988e47168ddf4d69900db1c9c94f4beb.png)
  - I'm gonna see if i can back up a 2TB mapped from an old toshiba drive I had to the rest of the system using what I think would be a RAID 5 system
- Played some more death stranding
  - Well I'm at the part where I have to go all the way back to lake knot by myself, thanks kojima :(
- Also, I think I'll get a summer class so I can do part-time studies, so thank goodness I have something over this summer

# JP

anki

- しないけど、最近「よつばと！」を初めて読んだ。
  - よつばちゃん、めっちゃかわいいじゃん！
  - 第１話完成

 

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
