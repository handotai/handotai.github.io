# Today stuff

- Another week past
- Some new things to think about
- I found out my parents had a Ipad 5th gen so I thrifted for a apple pencil 1st gen for 50 bucks, it seems fine so far so I'm pretty happy with it
  - I am gonna move from my wacom tablet to this since I think at this point it would be more efficient this way
  - Maybe I might do some art drawings but idk
- Went apartment hunting, went to 5 different apartments
  - Decided on applying to two, we'll see if me and my roommate gets accepted
  - Price-wise theyre kinda expensive, 2700-2500 ish per month split into two, so roughly \~1200 per person. We did a lot of back and forth determining what was best since some apartments had cockroaches or had car breakins and theft and stuff

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
