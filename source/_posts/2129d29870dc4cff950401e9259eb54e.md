# Today stuff

- Spent the entire day at uni
- Drove back up home for the weekend around 10 pm after packing some stuff
- bought a casio LK270 keyboard, pretty cool for 30 bux off goodwill
- Tested RTX 3070 on my PC back home, it works well
  - I played a bit of half life 2 RTX which i thought was cool
  - I kinda struggled in FPS though but i saw it was my CPU, since it was like 100% usage but my GPU was barely over half
  - Definitely gonna try to upgrade my PC soon 

 

# JP

anki

Immersion

# GUITAR

- No progress since yesterday
  - Still on haruka kanata verse 1, stuck on doing b over d sharp
  - I did a little bit of it but it still doesn't sound good

# ENGINEERING

- Thought about making a small BOM,  I saw that apparently there are such things as a 3.7V 10000 mAh = 37Wh LiPo battery which I think i can use for a potentially viable nucdeck idea.

 

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case

Nucdeck idea

- Need to test eGPU out
- I think I need to either buy a low power mobo or stick with a intel nuc canyon which has tb3 ports and either connect it to the eGPU or check the tech specs if the bandwidth of the mobo can support PCIEx16 speeds to make this build viable
