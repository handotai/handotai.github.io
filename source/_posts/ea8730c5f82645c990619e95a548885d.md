# Today stuff

- Following up on my PS4, yes it definitely was a cable issue
  - The blue ribbon cable for the DVD player had the gold contacts completely ripped off (probably from me)
  - I bought a replacement cable and now it works so yay
  - Actually another issue was that the rubber circle grommet on the inside of the PS4 disk reader was also dusty and dirty so it didn't hold onto the CD, as shown below in red.
  - ![588f817186f9324eae23c2f42b54ba93.png](/resources/47d72f51fc5f4e8086e390bcdd58e562.png)
  - After cleaning this part and re-assembling the drive it took disks in AND read them properly
  - My only gripe though is that the replacement cable I bought has the cable tail ends flipped so it does work but it might wear down over time so I should buy another one
  - And I guess another thing is that I can only change the disk when I put it in as it boots up, since for some reason it doesn't take disks when fully powered on which sucks
- I also went to da beach with my fam yesterday, ate a big ass burgah too
  - Funnily enough the beach is right next to the place I hiked so I brought up a pic and it was the mountain across from us and the location pinged extremely close
  - I brought my kindle on the family trip and the offline kindle library actually worked, that's so cool and has me stoked
- I also took a look at the Raspberry Pi GPU setup, okay I think I might have a lot more issues at my hand.
  - While the pi does recognize the GPU in lspci, it doesn't display anything at all when I plug it to an HDMI output, so that means the drivers weren't working
  - I only did this with the proprietary drivers though, I think Nouveau might fair better but there are some limitations since the GTX 1650 is NV170 I believe, which is newer
- Signed a lease for my apartment so I think I'm chilling
  - I just need to buy a fridge and wifi and we are good to go

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
