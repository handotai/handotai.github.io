# Today stuff

- Made food today
- Surfed the web for a new GPU, I'm thinking about upgrading to the RTX 3070
- Stayed at my apartment the entire day, prolly not the best use of my time
- I wonder if i can upload mp4 videos here that would be funny
- Im gonna try it

# GUITAR

- Did a bit of progress
  - Gonna do this <https://youtu.be/TfWhOWedWAY?t=2>
  - I learned how to do a power chord with my friend yesterday, bar chords are kinda hard
  - Right now I need muscle memory for chord transitions and I should be good to proceed
    - I had a bit of issue with strum rhythms for a bit

# ENGINEERING

- Thought about making a small BOM,  I saw that apparently there are such things as a 3.7V 10000 mAh = 37Wh LiPo battery which I think i can use for a potentially viable nucdeck idea.

 

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case

Nucdeck idea

- Need to test eGPU out
- I think I need to either buy a low power mobo or stick with a intel nuc canyon which has tb3 ports and either connect it to the eGPU or check the tech specs if the bandwidth of the mobo can support PCIEx16 speeds to make this build viable
- I looked at the NUCdeck for reference, but it seems that if I want to make this nucdeck have a hotswappable GPU i need to consider implementing a BMS system with the LiPo battery
- Since I have a small monitor already, what I could do is turn this into either a cyberdeck with a keeb + mouse OR i can make it into an AIO with batteries hooked up to the back
- I need to be veery careful though, the power consumption of the GPU requires 12V rails at all times, and so my battery packs have to be in series. I am thinking of doing some sort of battery array that looks like this:
  - ![Freehand Drawing.svg](/resources/44dfb27483ec4713b5c872f15914906f.svg)
  - In this configuration, I am buying an 8-pack since it is the cheapest I should buy to try it out in case I need more
  - The dimensions of each pack is 12 mm (H)\*60 mm (W)\*110 mm (L),
  - Each pack weighs roughly 5.6 oz \* 4 packs \* 2 arrays = 44.8 oz, or about 2.8 lbs.
  - As a handheld, the steam deck weighs 640 grams, or 1.41 lbs in comparison.
  - I think I would need to change my direction to make this more like a framework-type laptop since it would not be very viable as a handheld, or if I remove one 4x3.7V pack, I would only have 120 Wh to work with
    - On max output, the intel nuc requires 65W + 75W(1650) = 140W. What I could do is use the four battery packs left over and keep it as a backup, so I could just do 1 hour of operation if I was, say playing a game on it.
    - With the advantage that the GPU i have, the GTX 1650 is a PCIE-only powered GPU, I don't need to worry about having an additional PSU to add onto the bulk or power  consumption in our setup, since I'll only need a SATA power cable which I can obtain from the motherboard.

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb

Cool stuff

- Thought this keyboard idea was really cool <https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832768770080.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.1.1be120059LRsHb&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0%2Csearchweb201602_5_10065_10068_319_10059_10884_317_10887_10696_321_322_10084_453_10083_454_10103_10618_10307_537_536_10134%2Csearchweb201603_16%2CppcSwitch_0&algo_expid=c85583b6-e122-41bb-a564-b91a75af421f-0&algo_pvid=c85583b6-e122-41bb-a564-b91a75af421f&transAbTest=ae803_4&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt>

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- For nucdeck, I need to still verify if the NVME works or not, I wasn't able to get it working on another nuc so I'm concerned if this plan will go through.
- For learning guitar, these tutorials where it uses chords to make up the songs are pretty good and since weezer is popular enough i can start from there
