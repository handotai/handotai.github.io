# Today stuff

- Went to eat at an all you can eat restaurant
  - Was very full and very happy
- Got angry because my Mobo and CPU don't fit
  - I hate intel
  - Apparently these two CPUs, despite being the same socket (LGA 1200), don't fit because they are like manufacturer-restricted or something stupidly proprietary
  - I bought the CPU on the left and the CPU on the right is the correct seating

# GUITAR

- No progress since yesterday
  - Still on haruka kanata verse 1, stuck on doing b over d sharp
  - I did a little bit of it but it still doesn't sound good

# ENGINEERING

- Thought about making a small BOM,  I saw that apparently there are such things as a 3.7V 10000 mAh = 37Wh LiPo battery which I think i can use for a potentially viable nucdeck idea.

 

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case

Nucdeck idea

- Need to test eGPU out
- I think I need to either buy a low power mobo or stick with a intel nuc canyon which has tb3 ports and either connect it to the eGPU or check the tech specs if the bandwidth of the mobo can support PCIEx16 speeds to make this build viable

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb

Cool stuff

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
