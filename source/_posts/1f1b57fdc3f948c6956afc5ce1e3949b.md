# Today stuff

- Took a midterm, it was very very easy
  - I think i overstudied because i couldve used the time to do other things but whatever
- I bought a telescope for 20 bucks, the celestron astrowatcher 70AZ. I'm excited to try it out. I had to 3D print a clasp adapter for it though.
  - <https://www.printables.com/model/1307906-125-tripod-leg-stabilizer-clamp>
  - I needed another set of screws and bolts but other than that these fit well
- I upgraded my nextcloud to use local storage so that i can extend it
  - I accidentally ran out of storage earlier because I made another backup by mistake, which filled my entire storage
  - I copied the entire borg directory mount onto a hard drive so that should be good now
- I went to see a medieval MMA fighting, that shit was epic
  - Maybe I should go into that

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
