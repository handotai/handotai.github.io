# Today stuff

- Grr kinda frustrating that I've been sleeping at 12-1 AM and i still wake up at 9/fall asleep for like 3 hours mid-day
  - I think it was a combination of eating and idk maybe the diarrhea i had the day before messed me up
  - I think my dad was sick too so that mightve contributed a little
- Well I am learning alittle bit of cadding so I can create a 3d printed adapter for my AC funnel
  - Based off the Haier portable AC i bought for 20 bucks, it didnt come with an adapter or hose so I bought the hose but the hose also didnt come with the attachment so I decided to take measures and recreate it myself using pictures and measuring it with a caliper
  - You can find my attachment I made on onshape, its what I used for it
  - Ngl onshape is kinda dookie i might learn fusion360 or something else more intuitive/simpler cuz i dont need precision in my builds

  - Im prolly gonna make a 3d printed earbud case next cuz I lost my case but kept the earbuds with charging
- I ate gelato too that was pretty good

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
