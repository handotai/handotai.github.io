# Today stuff

- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
- Almost forgot to do this, almost a month apart
- Well mostly I've been working on getting my senior design done, midterms passed and went, so no issue there.
- Having issues getting accepted at jobs still though
- I drove a bunch to and from school so now I gotta do lab for a club
- I dont really have much to say other than I think my anki is really difficult and I think I need to immerse more and do them
- I have been listening to a lot of sakanaction, they are honestly so amazing
- Almost 5 weeks left until I graduate and then i'm out into the real world, both excited and frightened
  - I think when I do graduate i'm gonna make a personal video to myself and store it on my server, maybe when I grow up or someone finds it they can look back and see what kind of struggles and achievements I went through
  - In the future, I would also look ack and see what I have and haven't done
- I worked out today, though I pushed my back days to next workout session since I went back home to run with a friend of mine
- I was back home for the weekend after midterms so it was nice, I think I mostly did senior design project progress though. I drove a bunch to get parts and tested them out.
  - That's what I love about EE, you can just plan and see that the thing you made actually works and it's very much like a magic. I think if I could make a manga story of sorts I would do something to do with electronics
  - I packed a good majority of stuff back home since I'm not gonna be at uni for long
    - I gotta sell some stuff soon though, lotsa big stuff we don't need

# JP

anki

- 「鋼の錬金術師 」：第 1 話読書中
- 「ジョジョの奇妙な冒険：ステイるーぼルーラン」：第 **4** 話完成
- 「よつば＆！」：第 4 話完成
- チ。「―地球の運動について―」完成

 

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
