# Today stuff

- Oh man, I really stopped journaling after midterms huh

- Well right now it's summer and I haven't found an internship yet, kinda scared but I'm deciding on part-timing over the summer by working at daiso or doing research

  - I'm doing a research project but I'm also trying to get summer classes right now, if I can't I'll probably do part time

- A lot of new things happened though, good and bad but mostly good overall

  - I got an old tablet I am using for manga
  - I got a pixel 3a which I use to also read manga and do embedded hacking stuff on
    - I installed Nethunter so I'm gonna try running some mobile hacking dev things over this summer, alongside doing a CTF

- I bought a new monitor, the AOC Q27G40XMN, which was a huge upgrade since it was a MINI-LED instead of an LCD

  - Definitely worth the 250 (it was on sale). The blacks are as if it was off!
  - Though I do see the caveats, the local dimming does cause the nearby colors to be "dimmer" just due to the nature of how it has light zones, since it isn't an OLED, but I'd say it's worth it since it won't burn-in

- In regards to today however, I did do some cool stuff:

  - I upgraded my 3D printer so now my printer has a power supply built directly underneath the base so it isn't its own component:
    - I did have to buy M3 screws from home depot to make it work though, and it took a while to do the fitting.
  - I also played some death stranding, the game is SO LONG
    - I like the atmosphere and the problem solving it makes you think about before doing a expedition
    - I need to reread the lore cuz I think the one downside is that since this game takes so damn long I forgot most of the characters in it
    - I'm almost done (i think, just one last zone to complete), but I wonder if the end will be satisfying. The bosses were cool and gameplay mechanics are interesting but there seems to be a "power creep" in the game since everything always advances in level (like your gear), but you don't ever use it again. I wished there was a purpose in using old tech, but ever since getting the all-terrain skeleton I don't know why you'd want to use the others. Maybe that's the point.
  - (a couple days ago) I had to reconfigure and overhauled my Nextcloud to my intel NUC
    - Reason was because I didn't want my laptop to constantly charge and potentially cause a fire hazard since the lithium battery is always charging
      - I also wanted to reduce power consumption since the NUC is meant to do that (It could only max pull 24W in its power terminals anyways)
    - I am glad to be back on track to writing in my journal, ever since nextcloud stopped when I was back in uni.

# JP

anki

- しないけど、最近「よつばと！」を初めて読んだ。
  - よつばちゃん、めっちゃかわいいじゃん！
  - 第１話完成

 

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
