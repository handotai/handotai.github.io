# Today stuff

- Started regulating my sleep to around 12 AM - 1 AM
  - Feeling a bit better, waking up at 9 AM/10 AM now
- Read a lot of manga today
- Went to ikea to get some stuff, thinking of getting a shoe bench
- Still planning to continue with research, gotta ask grad student again on it
- Trying to tinker with raspberry pi on a GTX 1650 on an NVME M.2 slot, not having the best results but trying my best
  - Having issues with detecting, i think this PCIEx16 to M.2 is not that good
- Trying to find an apartment still for uni, good thing I have a roommate
  - Need to find a short term lease, but it's kinda hard since we want to plan it a couple months later, so we need to wait since it's too early
  - Hope we can get one by september
- I feel kinda sad, a family member of mine is going though a tough decision, it seems like they won't last long. The doctors told us that they had an option to do a transplant but nobody has done it in a while and it's super risky
  - Not only that but it doesn't solve the issue that they might get a heart attack, so it's not like they're out of the clear either
  - I just hope I can spend the last few years with them and appreciate what I have left

# JP

anki

- 「よつば＆！」：第１話完成
- 「ジョジョの奇妙な冒険：ステイるーぼルーラン」：第１話完成

 

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
