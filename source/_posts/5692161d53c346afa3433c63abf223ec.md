# Today stuff

- Went to microcenter > goodwill > ecotek
- Microcenter didnt have any deals on cases (the cheapest one was sold out)
  - Got bawls, the soda
  - I got the rootbeer flavor it kinda sucked since it was very medicine-y
- Goodwill didnt have much, but i found a cool power meter for 5 bucks which was worth i guess
- Ecotek had a coolermaster CPU cooler for 15 bucks but i didnt take it up since i didnt even have a PC case yet
  - But I bought a CPU for 5 bucks, the intel celeron G4440
  - Gonna use it as a testing CPU alongside the motherboard from a while ago (like day 15ish)
- Ate chinese food too that was yum
  - Raced my friend over there, even though i was there at the spot first I conceded my win to him..... I knew i was the winner deep inside
- After I went back to drive to uni and did some work 
  - Was figuring out a servo motor and found out I didnt do a common ground along the microcontroller so thats why it didnt work for the longest time with it

 

# JP

anki

Immersion

# GUITAR

- No progress since yesterday
  - Still on haruka kanata verse 1, stuck on doing b over d sharp
  - I did a little bit of it but it still doesn't sound good

# ENGINEERING

- Thought about making a small BOM,  I saw that apparently there are such things as a 3.7V 10000 mAh = 37Wh LiPo battery which I think i can use for a potentially viable nucdeck idea.

 

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case

Nucdeck idea

- Need to test eGPU out
- I think I need to either buy a low power mobo or stick with a intel nuc canyon which has tb3 ports and either connect it to the eGPU or check the tech specs if the bandwidth of the mobo can support PCIEx16 speeds to make this build viable
