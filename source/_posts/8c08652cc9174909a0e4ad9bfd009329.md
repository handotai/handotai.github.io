# Today stuff

- School haseth startedeth
- Gonna be a busy quarter but mostly because I needa pick up the pace with projects and applying
  - Since i have a light workload I'm planning to just blaze thru them like nothing, I have an online class and a class where the prof doesnt seem to care that much (guaranteeing an A)
- Started doing a little anki
  - Doing my mining deck now, since I think that's more productive at my skill level
- I bought a tube for my AC unit cuz it turned out the AC drain was leaking so I had to patch it up and put an output so it wouldnt go everywhere on the floor
- Also I fixed a issue with my nextcloud and joplin, I had to use a DNS server on my laptop and have my phone/tablet add it as an entry
  - I was super struggling to find out why my instances weren't working on my other devices until I looked around and found out that .local instances weren't supposed to be used for hosting private instances, since iOS overlaps that with their own thing called mDNS on .local websites
  - So in order to solve that, i used dnsmasq and edit the config at `nano $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf`

  - I added my entry under upstream DNS servers and my listen address from my laptop using `ipconfig getifaddr en0  # For Wi-Fi`, and then using `sudo brew services restart dnsmasq` to restart my dnsmasq
  - Then, on my phone, I added the DNS server ip to my DNS under the same wifi as the laptop and the search domain of my nextcloud instance. ![IMG\_8826.jpg](/resources/e7c2a59f57184bc7ad28ad94e41cf498.jpg)

# JP

anki

- 「よつば＆！」：第 2 話完成
- 「ジョジョの奇妙な冒険：ステイるーぼルーラン」：第 2 話完成

 

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
