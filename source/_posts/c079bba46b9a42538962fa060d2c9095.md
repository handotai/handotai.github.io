# Today stuff

- Went out today to get a haircut
  - Same as always, but took a while
  - After that I ate food at a restaurant, pretty good but I fell asleep after eating so much
- Kindle is basically almost done and ready for offline server use
  - So it turns out I had to do another step in the kindle process if I wanted to access Calibre
  - I had to use usbNetwork and manually set SSH online but in order to do that I had to use a script to block amazon websites from accessing my kindle on WiFi connection
  - Basically i followed the wiki instructions for turning on SSH via KUAL and then accessing it via USB at first <https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle4NTHacking>
  - Then I looked into a repository and found out you can use a script to run on your own computer and have it run amazon host blockers
  - <https://git.sr.ht/~sotirisp/kindle-hacks/tree/master/item/README.md>
  - I had to readjust the script for host blocking in OSX to make a directory for backup, since I didn't use the above website's script to create SSH hosts by using the line `mkdir -p /mnt/us/backup` after the line `/usr/sbin/mntroot rw > /dev/null 2>&1`, since it would error otherwise.
    - I also had to implement a SSH key on my mac and also put it on the kindle using `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub root@192.168.15.244` , where 192.168.15.244 was my kindle's USB port.
    - In addition since I was on OSX I had to change my USB ethernet config shown in the forum post below: <https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2895606&postcount=13>
  - After that I connected back onto my WiFi and it didn't pop up the developer change issues, which meant what I did worked! And I was able to verify it working when I loaded up KUAL and ran a local Calibre server. This means that now, all I need to set up is the raspberry pi server and I'm done.

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
