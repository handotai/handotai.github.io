# Today stuff

- GEAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH school is coming very soon
- I still have no idea why my financial aid loans arent applying to my tuition cost but I need to fix that, and I need to waiver out their health insurance plan cuz thats adding more to my cost
- I'm starting to get into kernel dev using a raspberry pi and an RX 560 GPU, it turns out that the Polaris line of GPUs work with Jeff Geerling's blog here: <https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/use-external-gpu-on-raspberry-pi-5-4k-gaming>
  - Had to follow step by step and made a lot of adjustments to get this running, probably the most time-consuming part was compiling the entire raspberry pi 6.6.y kernel. I accidentally compiled the Linux kernel but that was wrong; since when I applied the patches they errored.

  - After I downloaded the 6.6.y branch off the raspberry-pi kernel github, I did the patch steps shown on the website. I also had to enable the PCI Express 3.0 speeds. I used a PCIE x16 to NVME Adapter from Aliexpress - this one to be exact. <https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806827702170.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.56.693c1802CRqY0R&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa>

  - After applying the patches, it turns out I wasn't in the clear yet. I was getting a blank terminal screen on the HDMI output, and fiddled around in the config.txt:

  - Sorry i cant really paste this as code for some reason i think its messing up with markdown, but basically, I forced HDMI output and pcie gen 3 at 1080p. The console command is supposed to set the frame buffer to display out from the GPU's HDMI out.

  - I used this to create a new frame buffer for redirecting the output as well. I had a moment of realization when this was using X11, since I encountered this issue trying to use displaylink on a USB cable-connected display. I took the reference of the config files below using this: <https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/Framebuffer-use#x-server>

  - The 10-amdgpu.conf is shown below: ![5dd21c7fafde1a9be026f945b5afc1f7.png](/resources/685f5dfa9bff430eb2c507bfca7a4773.png)

  - The 99-fbdev.conf is shown below:
    ![5df9620a2149ecf52257d6a55c6b7eae.png](/resources/62bd02d911fe4986a8781e1f5da17bda.png)

  - After that I downloaded the amd gpu drivers, powered on the GPU from an external power supply, turned on my raspberry pi again, and it outputted the screen! I think if I were to go back though, I'd just use CoreForge's premodified kernel here and apply the patches: <https://github.com/Coreforge/linux/tree/rpi-6.6.y-gpu>

  - ![IMG\_8674.jpg](/resources/5109d688294645cbab069d580338a196.jpg)

  - It surpringly ran minecraft at 1080p 60fps in the demo version just fine, and using `amdgpu_top` I saw that it was utilizing the memory off the graphics card.

  - Right now the next steps I've been trying to do is configure windows on the Raspberry Pi, since it seems that the best way we can get Steam games is not through an emulator like Box86/Box64, as the software needs a specific kernel with 4KB memory tables, but the GPU patches work with 16KB, so this isn't possible.

  - A workaround I've been thinking about is trying to work on a patch off of Botspot's Virtual Machine, they have the whole script setup for having QEMU properly set up on the raspberry pi/ARM linux and they mentioned that the GPU guest drivers are the things that need done. <https://github.com/Botspot/bvm?tab=readme-ov-file>

  - I need to install this on my windows VM and work with it. Supposedly however, the optimizations can be poor and I would need to do a lot of tinkering.  <https://github.com/virtio-win/kvm-guest-drivers-windows/pull/943>

- 「ジョジョの奇妙な冒険：ステイるーぼルーラン」：第 2 話完成

 

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
