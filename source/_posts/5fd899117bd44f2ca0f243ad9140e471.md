# Today stuff

- Even moooore schooooolll
- uggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh had so much stress with senior design project and tests
  - Ngl i am kinda annoyed with my team members since we dont get much time to talk as much as I expected for the project
- Thinking about getting a part time job, I'm considering daiso or mitsuwa since they have some cool stuff
  - I'm considering mitsuwa since they have a really early supplier job that I could do part-time
  - Daiso cuz I think itd be cool to at least get to see items in japanese to help memorize 
- Finals coming up soon, and I put in my resignation for being group leads in some of my clubs for my last quarter
  - I just wanna graduate and relax this shit hella stressful
  - Also annoying to deal with people as a lead, I wanted to do more technical stuff but I can't with all this administration work
- Good thing though I'm driving early tomorrow around 12-ish to go home and celebrate thanksgiving
- I also finished a chapter of yotsubato and jojo so that was really nice
- I think my jp grammar is really baaaaadddddddddddddddd i need to practice it or at least study a formal book on it, it's seriously gonna be my downfall
- Also I plan to get an international drivers permit so I can drive in japan woooooo
  - I gotta get it before my insurance expires tho (im switching to another company)

# JP

anki

- 「よつば＆！」：第 **3** 話完成
- 「ジョジョの奇妙な冒険：ステイるーぼルーラン」：第 **3** 話完成

 

# GUITAR

- Did a little bit of warmup practice a few days ago

  - - Trying to get back into doing one hour a day of getting haruka kanata down as a start
- Still looking for a vox amplug that is cheap and a cool looking pickguard (maybe a dark red tortoise shell pattern?)

 

# ENGINEERING

Tablet idea

- Need to print a modified case
  - Kinda scrapped bc I think the monitor has magnetic interference so I don't know how viable or how I can amplify the pickup signals

Nucdeck idea

- THE DREAM IS OVER!!!!!!!!!!
  - I began to realize that, after reading online with regards to eGPU bandwidth that non-NVME communication speeds will NOT work with my nuc, therefore the NUCdeck is dead
  - It is a sad day, but within the ashes a new idea comes up: Raspberry pideck
    - However this only works with AMD GPUs, I want to test my 1650 on the Pi 5 and see how it goes
    - I want to learn how to make drivers so I might try getting into helping this github out: <https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices>

Nixie tube pocketwatch idea

- Need to do model and pcb
- I bought a hotplate and a microsolder, I can try desoldering or testing which tube burnt out on the clock and look into making the pocketwatch

 

# FUTURE PLANS

- Add 10 a day of kanji mining if possible, if not just review more
- Create a schedule for doing workouts and also all my hobbies (programming, guitar, gaming, research)
